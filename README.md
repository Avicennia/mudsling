# mudsling
A most modestly made mudsling mod merely meant for mirthful midsummer Minetest monkeyshining

When you want Tinker's Construct but your mom says, "We have Slimesling at home."

## usage
Simply **rightclick** to launch yourself. Direction is similar to the "Slimesling" from Minecraft's Tinker's Construct mod (opposite your facing direction). Leftclicking will change the sling's power, and **shift-leftclicking** will display the sling's power HUD element. Pressing **shift** mid-flight will cancel your current trajectory, allowing you to sling again!
